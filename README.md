The goal of this project was to create an interactive customer dashboard in Tableau to help stakeholders analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and engagement. The dashboard serves as a tool for marketing and management teams to understand key performance indicators (KPIs) for both Sales and Customer insights. 

The final interactive dashboard can be viewed on Tableau Public here: [Sales & Customer Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robert.smith7087/viz/shared/QQRF2PZGP)

This document was provided with a data set to build a Tableau dashboard fulfilling the requested insights needed by a marketing team. From this email, we have decerned that the client wants: 

1.Create Customer Dashboard (attached to sales dashboard)
- A new dashboard attached to our previously made Sales dashboard that allows quick and actionable insights into customer trends

2. **KPI Overview**
Three key performance indicators were developed to summarize customer activity:
- **Total Number of Customers**
- **Total Sales Per Customer**
- **Total Number of Orders**
Each KPI is visualized using **line charts**, allowing users to observe **monthly trends over two years (current and previous)**.

3. **Customer Distribution by Number of Orders**
- A **bar chart with frequency bins** created to show how customers are distributed based on the number of orders placed.
- Align customer orders in fruequency bins to allow quick insights into the average number of orders each customer makes.

4. **Top 10 Customers by Profit**
- A **ranked table** that displays the top 10 customers contributing the most profit.
- This should include customer data such as: Customer Rank, Name, current sale's, current profit, order date and Number of Orders made.

5. **Interactivity in Dashboard**
- Dashboard should be fully interactive with filters, ability to change the year, clickable charts and the ability to switch sheets easily
- all data should be able to connect with eachother and be full interactable by the client for specific insights.

The final dashboard was published to Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robert.smith7087/viz/shared/QQRF2PZGP
